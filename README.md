_Momba_ is a Python framework for dealing with quantitative models centered around the [JANI-model](http://www.jani-spec.org/) interchange format.
Momba strives to deliver an integrated and intuitive experience to aid the process of model construction, validation, and analysis.
It provides convenience functions for the modular construction of models effectively turning Python into a syntax-aware macro language for quantitative models.
Momba's built-in exploration engine allows gaining confidence in a model, for instance, by rapidly prototyping a tool for interactive model exploration and visualization, or by connecting it to a testing framework.
Finally, thanks to the JANI-model interchange format, several state-of-the-art model checkers and other tools are readily available for model analysis.

- **syntax-aware macros** for the modular construction of models with Python code
- **built-in exploration engine** for PTAs, MDPs and other model types
- interfaces to state-of-the-art model checkers, e.g., the [Modest Toolset](http://www.modestchecker.net/) and [Storm](https://www.stormchecker.org/)
- **an [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com) compatible interface** for training agents on formal models
- pythonic and **statically typed** APIs to tinker with formal models
- hassle-free out-of-the-box support for **Windows, Linux, and MacOS**

## üöÄ Getting Started

Momba is available from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/):

```sh
pip install momba[all]
```

Installing Momba with the `all` feature flag will install all optional dependencies unleashing the full power and all features of Momba.
Check out the [examples](https://koehlma.github.io/momba/examples) or read the [user guide](https://koehlma.github.io/momba/guide) to learn more.

If you aim at a fully reproducible modeling environment, we recommend using [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) or [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
We also provide a [GitHub Template](https://github.com/koehlma/momba-pipenv-template) for Pipenv.

## üèó Contributing

We welcome all kinds of contributions!

For minor changes and bug fixes feel free to simply open a pull request. For major changes impacting the overall design of Momba, please first [start a discussion](https://github.com/koehlma/momba/discussions/new?category=ideas) outlining your idea.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Licensing

Momba is licensed under either [MIT](https://github.com/koehlma/momba/blob/main/LICENSE-MIT) or [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/koehlma/momba/blob/main/LICENSE-APACHE) at your opinion.

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in this project by you, as defined in the Apache 2.0 license, shall be dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.

## ü¶Ä Rust Crates

The exploration engine of Momba is written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) levering [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/) for Python bindings.
In case you are a Rust developer you might find some of the crates in [engine/crates](engine/crates) useful.
In particular, the crate [momba-explore](https://crates.io/crates/momba-explore) allows developing model analysis tools with JANI support in Rust based on Momba's explicit state space exploration engine.
The Rust command line tool [`momba-sidekick`](https://crates.io/crates/momba-sidekick) directly exposes some of this functionality.
