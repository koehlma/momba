*Momba* is a Python framework for dealing with quantitative models centered around the [JANI-model](http://www.jani-spec.org/) interchange format.
Momba strives to deliver an integrated and intuitive experience to aid the process of model construction, validation, and analysis.
It provides convenience functions for the modular construction of models effectively turning Python into a syntax-aware macro language for quantitative models.
Momba's built-in exploration engine allows gaining confidence in a model, for instance, by rapidly prototyping a tool for interactive model exploration and visualization, or by connecting it to a testing framework.
Finally, thanks to the JANI-model interchange format, several state-of-the-art model checkers and other tools are readily available for model analysis.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Momba is available from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/):
```sh
pip install momba[all]
```
Installing Momba with the `all` feature flag will install all optional dependencies unleashing the full power and all features of Momba.
Check out the [examples](https://koehlma.github.io/momba/examples) or read the [user guide](https://koehlma.github.io/momba/guide) to learn more.

If you aim at a fully reproducible modeling environment, we recommend using [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) or [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
We also provide a [GitHub Template](https://github.com/koehlma/momba-pipenv-template) for Pipenv.


## üèó Contributing

We welcome all kinds of contributions!

For minor changes and bug fixes feel free to simply open a pull request. For major changes impacting the overall design of Momba, please first [start a discussion](https://github.com/koehlma/momba/discussions/new?category=ideas) outlining your idea.

To get you started, we provide a [development container for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) containing everything you need for development. The easiest way to get up and running is by clicking on the following badge:

[![VS Code: Open in Container](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=VS%20Code&message=Open%20in%20Container&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/koehlma/momba.git)

Opening the link in VS Code will clone this repository into its own Docker volume and then start the provided development container inside VS Code so you are ready to start coding.

## ü¶Ä Rust Crates

The exploration engine of Momba is written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) levering [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/) for Python bindings.
In case you are a Rust developer you might find some of the crates in [engine/crates](engine/crates) useful.
In particular, the crate [momba-explore](https://crates.io/crates/momba-explore) allows developing model analysis tools with JANI support in Rust based on Momba's explicit state space exploration engine.
The Rust command line tool [`momba-sidekick`](https://crates.io/crates/momba-sidekick) directly exposes some of this functionality.
