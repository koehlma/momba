## Development
Momba uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Run `poetry install` to create a virtual environment in `.venv` containing all the dependencies needed for development.
Momba comes with a configuration for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which requires the virtual environment to be present in `.venv` and enables linting and type checking.
