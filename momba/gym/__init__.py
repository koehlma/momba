    Constructs a generic training environment from a JANI model based on the provided options.

        network: A JANI automaton network.
        controlled_instance: An instance of an automaton in the provided network. The
            decision-making agent trained on the resulting environment is assumed to act
            by resolving the non-determinism in this automaton.
        property_name: The name of a reach-avoid JANI property (specified as part of the
            JANI model the network originates from) for which the agent should be trained.
        parameters: Allows defining values for parameters of the JANI model.
        rewards: Specifies the reward structure used for training.
        actions: Specifies the action space for the environment.
        observations: Specifies the observation space for the environment.
